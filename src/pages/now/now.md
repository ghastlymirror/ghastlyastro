Some of the more fragile fish died despite by attemtps, but hopefully there wont be more of them, I also changed the water and decided to use garlic to supliment their diet and help with their imune system.

Been Bird watching a bit more thanks to a pair of binoculars I got as a gift, just saw a seagull catching and eating a crab in great detail.
