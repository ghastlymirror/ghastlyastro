## **Video Summary**

After spending some time as a Vampire the next step was to figure out how to become a werewolf, t took some digging but I finally managed to posses him. He comes with handy dandy skills of picking up scents and well turning into a wolf.

I also found one the ex-members of the band! She looks kinda green around the gills if you know what I mean, I also found Fangs, the bandÂ´s lead singer.

So now I gotta figure out how to reach them, which is easier said than done.
